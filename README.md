# Dijkstra's-Flight-Path
Developed an interactive tool to visualize and animate the shortest path between countries using Dijkstra's algorithm. This project calculates the minimum distance between any two countries and provides a smooth animation of the optimal route on a map, enhancing geographical insights and user engagement.
